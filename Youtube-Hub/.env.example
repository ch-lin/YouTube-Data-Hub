# =============================================================================
# This file contains environment variables for configuring the Docker Compose setup.
# It should not be committed to version control if it contains sensitive data.
# Instead, create a .env.example file with placeholder values.
# =============================================================================

# =============================================================================
# Database Configuration
# =============================================================================
# Password for the 'root' user within the MySQL database container.
# This is used for administrative tasks inside the container, like the healthcheck.
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=

# The username for the application's dedicated database user.
# The backend and downloader services will use this to connect to the database.
MYSQL_USER=

# The password for the application's database user.
MYSQL_PASSWORD=

# =============================================================================
# Host Path Mappings (Volumes)
# =============================================================================
# Specifies the directory on the host machine to store the MySQL database data.
# This ensures that your database data persists even if the container is removed.
YOUTUBE_HUB_DB_DATA_PATH=

# =============================================================================
# Public Frontend Service URL
# =============================================================================
# The public-facing URL of the frontend application. This is crucial for
# NextAuth.js to construct correct redirect URLs for authentication.

# By leaving NEXTAUTH_URL commented out, NextAuth.js will dynamically determine
# the URL from request headers. This is the desired behavior for supporting
# both local and reverse-proxied access. The `trustHost: true` option in
# `auth.ts` is required for this to work securely.
# NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# =============================================================================
# YouTube Hub Default Configuration
# =============================================================================
# These credentials are used to create the initial 'default' configuration for the YouTube Hub API.
# The API key can be the same as the one used by the frontend.
YOUTUBE_HUB_DEFAULT_YOUTUBE_API_KEY=
YOUTUBE_HUB_DEFAULT_CLIENT_ID=
YOUTUBE_HUB_DEFAULT_CLIENT_SECRET=

# =============================================================================
# Authentication Configuration
# =============================================================================
# A secret key used by NextAuth.js for signing cookies, JWTs, and other
# security-related functions. It should be a long, random string.
# You can generate a suitable secret with the command: `openssl rand -base64 32`
AUTH_SECRET=

# =============================================================================
# Public URLs
# =============================================================================
# The public-facing URL of the frontend, as seen by any browser on the network.
# This is used by the backend services to configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3000"

# =========================================================
# 🟢 Optional
# The default value is defined in docker-compose.yml.
# =========================================================

# =============================================================================
# Service Ports
# =============================================================================
# Defines the external ports on the host machine that map to the internal ports
# of the services running in Docker containers.
# FRONTEND_PORT="3000"
# BACKEND_PORT="8083"
# YOUTUBE_HUB_DB_PORT="3306"

# The name of the database schema that will be created and used by the application.
# YOUTUBE_HUB_MYSQL_DATABASE="youtubehub"

# =============================================================================
# Public Backend Service API URLs
# =============================================================================
# The public-facing URL of the Authentication API. This is passed as a build argument
# to the frontend Docker image so it knows where to send API requests.
# AUTH_SERVICE_API_URL="http://authentication-backend:8080"

# The public-facing URL of the backend API. This is passed as a build argument
# to the frontend Docker image so it knows where to send API requests.
# PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL="http://youtube-hub-backend:8080"

# The public-facing URL of the downloader API. This is passed as a build argument
# to the frontend Docker image so it knows where to send API requests.
# PUBLIC_DOWNLOADER_URL="http://downloader-backend:8080"

# =============================================================================
# Environment Configuration
# =============================================================================
# Specifies the environment file to load for service configuration (e.g., .env.base, .env.dev).
# This is used in docker-compose.yml to dynamically include the correct env file.
# APP_ENV_FILE=".env.dev"
