# =============================================================================
# This file contains environment variables for configuring the Docker Compose setup.
# It should not be committed to version control if it contains sensitive data.
# Instead, create a .env.example file with placeholder values.
# =============================================================================

# =============================================================================
# Public Frontend Service URL
# =============================================================================
# The public-facing URL of the frontend application. This is crucial for
# NextAuth.js to construct correct redirect URLs for authentication.

# By leaving NEXTAUTH_URL commented out, NextAuth.js will dynamically determine
# the URL from request headers. This is the desired behavior for supporting
# both local and reverse-proxied access. The `trustHost: true` option in
# `auth.ts` is required for this to work securely.
# NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# =============================================================================
# Authentication Configuration
# =============================================================================
# A secret key used by NextAuth.js for signing cookies, JWTs, and other
# security-related functions. It should be a long, random string.
# You can generate a suitable secret with the command: `openssl rand -base64 32`
AUTH_SECRET=

# =========================================================
# 🟢 Optional
# The default value is defined in docker-compose.yml.
# =========================================================

# =============================================================================
# Service Ports
# =============================================================================
# Defines the external ports on the host machine that map to the internal ports
# of the services running in Docker containers.
# FRONTEND_PORT="3000"

# =============================================================================
# Public Backend Service API URLs
# =============================================================================
# The public-facing URL of the Authentication API. This is passed as a build argument
# to the frontend Docker image so it knows where to send API requests.
# AUTH_SERVICE_API_URL="http://authentication-backend:8080"

# The public-facing URL of the backend API. This is passed as a build argument
# to the frontend Docker image so it knows where to send API requests.
# PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL="http://youtube-hub-backend:8080"

# The public-facing URL of the downloader API. This is passed as a build argument
# to the frontend Docker image so it knows where to send API requests.
# PUBLIC_DOWNLOADER_URL="http://downloader-backend:8080"

# =============================================================================
# Environment Configuration
# =============================================================================
# Specifies the environment file to load for service configuration (e.g., .env.base, .env.dev).
# This is used in docker-compose.yml to dynamically include the correct env file.
# APP_ENV_FILE=".env.dev"
